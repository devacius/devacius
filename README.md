<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Deepansh Gupta</h1> <h3 align="center">Senior Software Developer and unapologetic Anime Enjoyer from India</h3> 
I’m currently working as a Full Stack Developer at a US-based startup, building things that occasionally behave on the first try (miracles do happen).

These days I’m diving deep into LLMs, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence—because apparently I wasn’t confused enough already.

I’m open to collaborating on any project that has the potential to mildly terrify me or ruin my weekend in a fun way.

You can reach me at deepanshgupta27092020@gmail.com
 in case you have interesting problems, opportunities, or life-changing memes.

Fun fact: I’m not a workaholic, but I will absolutely drop everything to work on a tricky problem or an idea that refuses to leave my brain. I spend time with my family, I exercise, I try to be a sane human—but nothing feels as good as building something that actually solves a real problem. I love tackling tough challenges, breaking things, fixing them again, and learning whatever weird new tech shows up in the process.
